# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The bug and solution are provided in separate files (bug.js and bugSolution.js). The bug showcases an implementation where the API call works fine, but the FlatList remains empty. The solution shows a corrected version fixing this behavior. 

## Bug Description
The FlatList component doesn't display data after fetching data successfully from a remote API.  No errors are thrown, and error handling mechanisms aren't triggered, leading to an empty list.  This problem is often caused by subtle issues related to data handling or component lifecycle.  Please review the `bug.js` for details and `bugSolution.js` for the solution.
